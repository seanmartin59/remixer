## Next Steps or Considerations

### Consider Pivoting from `.jsx` to `.tsx`

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Use interfaces and types for readability.
- **Better Tooling**: Enhanced autocompletion and error checking.
- **Learning Opportunity**: Gain new skills with TypeScript.
- **Community Support**: Access to resources and support.

### Steps to Transition

1. **Learn TypeScript Basics**: Explore syntax and features.
2. **Start Small**: Convert a few components to `.tsx`.
3. **Integrate Gradually**: Use `.ts`/`.tsx` with `.js`/`.jsx`.
4. **Use TypeScript Tools**: Employ `tsc` and `tslint`.
5. **Seek Community Help**: Reach out for support if needed.

By considering these steps, we can make an informed decision about whether and when to transition to TypeScript, ensuring that our project remains robust and maintainable as it evolves.

### Next Steps

- **Understand Privacy Implications**: 
  - **Secure Storage**: Store API keys in environment variables or secure vaults, not in source code.
  - **Access Control**: Limit access to API keys to only those who need it.
  - **Regular Rotation**: Rotate API keys regularly to minimize risk.
  - **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of API key usage to detect any unauthorized access.
  - **Encrypt Transmission**: Ensure API keys are transmitted over secure channels (e.g., HTTPS).
  - **Compliance**: Stay informed about and comply with relevant privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
